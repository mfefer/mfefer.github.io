## About my Hetch Hetchy research

In addition to my interests in water resources modeling, I am also interested in the history of how California's water resources have developed. I have been researching the history of Hetch Hetchy and the efforts of the engineers to construct it. 

The intersection of public policy and engineering projects particularly interests me. I am currently preparing a paper for submission this summer detailing new findings about Hetch Hetchy's history and exploring the role of engineers in the policy process of large infrastructure projects.
