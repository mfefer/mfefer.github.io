## Welcome

Welcome to my personal website! I am currently a Masters candidate at UC Davis and my advisor is [Professor Jon Herman](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/herman/). My work includes hydro-economic modeling of California's water system using PyVIN and examining how climate variability will affect the management of our water resources. I am also interested in water policy and water history and currently working on a paper regarding the engineers involved in the establishment of San Francisco's reservoir in the Hetch Hetchy valley. When I finish my degree, I will be searching for a full time position at a consulting firm or public agency in water resources engineering. Please enjoy reading about my research areas and pictures of my travels.
